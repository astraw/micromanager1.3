This is tested on Ubuntu 8.04 but debian should be fine too I think

1. install packages:
sun-java6-sdk or better/equivalent
autoconf
automake
swig
libace-dev
g++
libtool

imagej package, if not in your repository then here:
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/intrepid/i386/imagej/1.40a-1ubuntu1
http://launchpadlibrarian.net/16007457/imagej_1.40a-1ubuntu1_all.deb

If you cannot use the package, get ImageJ source code. Download and install from
http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html.

2. ./mmUnixBuild.sh

3. ./configure
   if you had to download the IJ source code, then replace this by 
   run ./configure --with-imagej=/home/mahogny/umanager/ImageJ
   with whatever path to imagej fits in your case

4. (will not be needed later when bug has been fixed) change /usr/include/ace/config-lite.h

error _REENTRANT has to be defined!
into
define _REENTRANT

5. make

6. make install

7. ldconfig
