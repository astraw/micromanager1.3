<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Some devices
   do not signal when they are done with a command. You therefore have to 'guess' how long 
   execution of this command will take (often, the documentation to the device will help establish this information).  
Setting this value too low might - for instance - result in images taken before a shutter is fully open.  Setting this value too high might result in unneccessary delays.
<br>
<br>
Devices that may require setting delays are mostly shutters
or filter wheels. If the device has normal synchronization capabilities, or
if you are unsure, leave this parameter at 0 ms.<br>
