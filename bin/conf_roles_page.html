Micro-Manager can work with multiple cameras, shutters and Z-stages (focus drives), however, at any given time only one of these is the 'active' one. 
The software needs to know which camera is going to be
treated as the default one, which shutter will be associated with the camera
and which stage is going to be used for focusing. These
roles can later be changed on-the-fly through configuration presets.
